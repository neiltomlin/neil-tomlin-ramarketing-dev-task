# neil-tomlin-ramarketing-dev-task

##Preparation
Before beginning the development task, I decided to:
 - Read and reread the brief, taking note of requested technologies
 - Considered the implications of using those technologies and what benefits others might provide
 - Viewed the images and wireframes, taking note of the UX pointers and how I would solve the problem
 - Considered importance of end user experience and cost if this were a real scenario (minimum http requests, small files, etc.)
 - Set up my git repository and began a new project
 - Set up required build tools (node-sass, http-server etc.) to provide good development environment and finished deliverable
 
 ##Beginning Development
 Without access to Adobe CS or a design styleguide, it wasn't the simplest task to generate font colours and images but I opted to settle for a colour picker tool and cropping from the existing images. Were this a real life scenario, I would make a list of the required assets and return to UX/design handover. Given that this is a development task for a job application, I've settled for this makeshift solution.
